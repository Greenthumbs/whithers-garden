For more information on the history of what was covered in this video, you can check out the following references:

-   Jay Ose’s false triple cut to the table was published in Harry Lorayne’s book _Close-up Card Magic_, 1962.
-   The false swing cut can be found as “Paul Rosini’s False Cut” in _The Tarbell Course in Magic - Volume 3_, 1943.
-   The Greek Shuffle shows up in the literature at least as early as the late nineteenth century, see for example the German 1896 classic _Der moderne Kartenkünstler_.
-   The false cut from the hand to the table can be found in S. W. Erdnase’s book _The Expert at the Card Table_, 1902. Adding a tap to these kinds of cuts was a relatively recent invention, and a swing card version was conceived by Bobby Bernard in the 1950s according to Jerry Sadowitz’s _Cut Controls_, 2004.
-   The false cut in three packets is based on the first of the Fancy Blind Cuts from _The Expert at the Card Table_, 1902.
